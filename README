GENERAL DESCRIPTION
===================
This project will eventually become a control point for handling a large database of TV Shows (both metadata, and actual episodes).

For now, it consists of an episode renamer, and a .torrent downloader

Episode Renamer
===============
There is an external dependancy on BeautifulSoup for this module

This module runs against its own current directory (for now)

Run Examples:
  python ./episodeRenamer.py -e -p "SouthPark"
  - This will run the renamer against all files, using the epguides.com parser (-e)
  - This will execute the renamer in 'preview' mode (no rename actually occurs)
  - This will use the name "SouthPark" as the SeriesID (ensure you know this)

  python ./episodeRenamer.py -e "SouthPark"
  - This will be identical to the above, but the file will actually be renamed.


Torrent Grabber
===============
