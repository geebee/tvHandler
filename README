GENERAL DESCRIPTION
===================
This project will eventually become a control point for handling a large database of TV Shows (both metadata, and actual episodes).

For now, it consists of an episode renamer, and a .torrent downloader

Episode Renamer
===============
There is an external dependancy on BeautifulSoup for this module

This module runs against its own current directory by default, but can be set to any directory that the user can write to with the -f <folder> / --folder=<folder> option

The file on its own is also importable inside any other python script, and its options can be set via standard variable passing to the main function
  - All the same defaults as the command line switches are preserved
  - For example:
     import episodeRenamer
     episodeRenamer.main(title="SouthPark", verbose=True, folder="..")

Run Examples:
  python ./episodeRenamer.py -h
  - This will print out the usage information and options (as below), then quit
  
  TV Episode Renamer - Usage:    python ./episodeRenamer.py --title="SHOW TITLE" [other options]
    -h, --help           This help message
    -v, --verbose        Turn on verbose output
    -p, --preview        Don't actually rename files
    -m, --mask="MASK"    printf style string for renaming mask
      def: %(show)s - S%(series_num)02dE%(episode_num)02d - %(title)s.%(extension)s
    -t, --title="TITLE"  Sets the show title for the search

  python ./episodeRenamer.py -t "SouthPark" -p
  - This will execute the renamer in 'preview' mode (no rename actually occurs)
  - This will use the name "SouthPark" as the SeriesID (ensure you know this)
  - This will use the current directory for renaming

  python ./episodeRenamer.py -t "SouthPark"
  - This will be identical to the above, but the file will actually be renamed.

  python ./episodeRenamer.py --title="SouthPark" --verbose --folder="~/episodes/South Park"
  - This will be identical to the above, but the file will actually be renamed.
